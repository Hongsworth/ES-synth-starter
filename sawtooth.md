## Sawtooth Wave Tone

### Method of Implementation
This was done by setting an array of stepsizes[] corresponding to each note on the piano. The program samples at a frequency of 22000 and at each period if a key was pressed then the correpoding step size is added to the phase accumulator, therefore creating a sawtooth wave.
